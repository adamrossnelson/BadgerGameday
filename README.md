# Badgers Gameday

The lost art of ASCII drawing. Use these files to generate UW-Madison animations in Stata. Planning additions for R, Python, and others.

### For a quick run enter the following in Stata's command line

```
do "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamrossnelson/BadgerGameday/master/GameDayStata.do"
```
Or if you want it framed and with falling snow try:

```
do "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamrossnelson/BadgerGameday/master/GameDayStataSnow.do"
```
No installation or downloads necessary.

### Stata to R Cross-Reference

Started as April 1st joke. But, the cross-walk cross-reference is handy.
