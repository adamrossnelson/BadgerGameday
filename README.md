# Badgers Gameday
## Intrdoction

The lost art of ASCII drawing. Use these files to generate UW-Madison animations in Stata.

Two additional examples of side-by-side Stata, Python, & R projects (Rosetta Stones) found at [Rosetta Stone](https://github.com/adamrossnelson/rosetta) and at [crossreg](https://github.com/adamrossnelson/crossreg).

### For a quick run enter the following in Stata's command line

```
do "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamrossnelson/BadgerGameday/master/GameDayStata.do"
```
Stata Users: Or if you want it framed and with falling snow try:
```
do "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamrossnelson/BadgerGameday/master/GameDayStataSnow.do"
```
R Users: Can run from the command line:
```
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamrossnelson/BadgerGameday/master/GameDayStataSnow.R")
```
No installation or downloads necessary.

## Other side-by-side code examples

See: [BadgerGameday](https:github.com/adamrossnelson/BadgerGameday) or [rosetta](https://github.com/adamrossnelson/rosetta).  

This [StataQuickReference](https://github.com/adamrossnelson/StataQuickReference) repot also offers a [Stata to Pandas Cross-Walk](https://github.com/adamrossnelson/StataQuickReference/blob/master/spcrosswlk.md).

### Stata to R cross-reference

Started as April 1st joke. But, the cross-walk cross-reference is handy.
